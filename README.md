For example, with `lang_code`.json files encoded in the following pattern:

`
{"heres": "a translation"}
`

You can point this program to that directory of json files, add the location in the json you would like to add the translation, and the program will automatically translate the text for you and put it in the proper place.

`pip install requirements.txt && python main.py`
